# babylon-course

Babylon.JS course from https://www.udemy.com/course/single-multiplayer-game-development-in-webgls-babylonjs/ re-written in typescript and using node. The course is a walkthrough on making a simple shooter game along with introducing the basic principals of Babylon.JS. It is a great course and I highly recommend it, but the only downfall is that it uses vainala javascrip and no package managers. The main goals of this project are:

- Learning the Babylon.JS library
- Create an identicall game to the course using TypeScript and node.
- Doing my best to provide orginised and well written code.
